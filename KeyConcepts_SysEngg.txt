Deriation: the creation of requirement based on an anlaysis of 
higher-order requirements (eg. availablity requirements)

Allocation: the assignment of a reqirement to one or more system elements 
within the architecture. (eg. thrust requiremnt > propulsion requirements)

Flow Down: assigning requirement to one or more lower level elements. 
(eg. water resistant requirement > all elements exposed to outside 
environment)

Traceability: the creation of linkage from one system elements to others
(eg. mtbf requirements > availability requirements)
