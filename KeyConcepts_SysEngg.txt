Deriation: the creation of requirement based on an anlaysis of 
higher-order requirements (eg. availablity requirements)

Allocation: the assignment of a reqirement to one or more system elements 
within the architecture. (eg. thrust requiremnt > propulsion requirements)

Flow Down: assigning requirement to one or more lower level elements. 
(eg. water resistant requirement > all elements exposed to outside 
environment)

Traceability: the creation of linkage from one system elements to others
(eg. mtbf requirements > availability requirements)

System engineer must know how: 
- test able
- Produced 
- packaged 
- transported

Pre-planned product improvement requirements (P3I)

Sys Engg mush work with reliability SMEs

RFA - request for action
RFI - request for information

RVTM - requirements verification and traceability matrix

How to write requirement statement: 
- Specific intent
- Desired capability
- Desired level of performance
- Functions or behavioral characteristis
- Not specifying how functions/behaviors are performed (calling for specific components) 
 - requirement should not specify specific piece of hardware of software into the system
- determining proper hardware or software is not job description of the systems engineer. It is job of SMEs. 
- each requirements should be unambiguous (all parties have same understanding of the requirements)
- requirement should be complete (stand alone, independent of other requirements, avoid cross referencing other requirements, avoid pronoun)
- requirement must be feasible (should not request impossible or unrealistic behavior or feature, some time all req are individually feasible but collection of them are not feasible)
- requirements should be verifiable (analysis, demonstration, test or inspection) 
- requirement can use illustration/ graphics
